how to check ec2 ssh connection failure

ssh -i public_key_my.pem   ec2-user@10.0.24.51

sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

amending the 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config PasswordAuthentication yes 

re-started the service using
sudo systemctl restart sshd

[vini@random ~]$ ls -ld ~

drwx------. 3 vini vini 127 Nov 23 15:29 /home/vini
if it is not like this, run

chmod 0700 /home/your_home
Now check .ssh folder

[vini@random ~]$ ls -ld  /home/vini/.ssh/

drwx------. 2 vini vini 29 Nov 23 15:28 /home/vini/.ssh/
if it is not looking like this, run

chmod 0700 /home/your_home/.ssh
now make sure that authorized_keys looks like this

[vini@venon ~]$ ls -ld  /home/vini/.ssh/authorized_keys 

-rw-------. 1 vini vini 393 Nov 23 15:28 /home/vini/.ssh/authorized_keys
or just run

chmod 0600 /home/your_home/.ssh/authorized_keys
After that go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config

For best security set

PermitRootLogin no

PubkeyAuthentication yes
keep as yes for testing purposes

PasswordAuthentication yes
Make sure that

ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
Comment those lines for GSSAPI

# #GSSAPIAuthentication yes
# #GSSAPICleanupCredentials no
Make sure that is set to UsePAM yes

UsePAM yes
now restart sshd service

systemctl restart sshd 
on the client side

cd /home/your_home/.ssh

As everybody else has already said you need to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change PasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes

I ran into this problem setting up a Vagrant box - so therefore it makes sense to script this and do it automatically in a shell provisioner:

sudo sed -i 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config;

sudo systemctl restart sshd;

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

1.PubkeyAuthentication yes

2.PasswordAuthentication yes

3.GSSAPIKeyExchange no

4.GSSAPICleanupCredentials no

systemctl restart sshd

ssh-keygen

chmod 777 /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@ipaddress

According to the line debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-with-mic , ssh password authentication is disabled and apparently you are not using public key authentication.

Login to your server using console and open /etc/ssh/sshd_config file with an editor with root user and look for line PasswordAuthentication then set it's value to yes and finally restart sshd service.
